# How to Choose a Wedding Videographer in NYC: 10 Questions to Ask

You've booked the venue, found the dress, and secured the photographer. Now comes one of the most important decisions: choosing your wedding videographer.

Your wedding film is the only way to truly relive your day—the vows, the toasts, the laughter, the tears. Unlike photos, video captures the movement, the voices, the energy. It's the difference between remembering and *experiencing* your wedding all over again.

But with hundreds of videographers in NYC, how do you choose the right one?

As a wedding filmmaker who's been capturing love stories across New York for 5 years, I've seen couples make great decisions—and painful mistakes. Here are the exact 10 questions you should ask before booking anyone.

---

## 1. "Can I see full wedding films, not just highlight reels?"

**Why this matters:** Highlight reels showcase a videographer's best 3-5 minutes. Anyone can make 5 minutes look good. A full wedding film reveals their storytelling ability, pacing, and consistency.

**What to look for:**
- Do they maintain quality throughout the entire film?
- Is the audio clear during vows and speeches?
- Does the story flow naturally, or does it feel choppy?
- Are there awkward edits or dead space?

**Red flag:** If they only show you 90-second Instagram reels and can't (or won't) show full films, that's a warning sign.

---

## 2. "What's your filming style—documentary, cinematic, or traditional?"

**Why this matters:** Different styles create different feelings.

**Documentary style:**
- Mostly candid, unposed moments
- Natural lighting and minimal direction
- Feels authentic and journalistic

**Cinematic style:**
- Stylized shots, intentional framing
- May include slow-motion, drone footage, creative angles
- Feels like a movie

**Traditional style:**
- Straightforward coverage of events as they happen
- Less artistic interpretation
- Comprehensive but less emotive

**My take:** Most modern videographers blend documentary and cinematic. Ask to see examples of their work and make sure it matches your vision. If you want epic slow-motion shots but they shoot purely documentary, it's not a fit.

---

## 3. "Who will actually film my wedding?"

**Why this matters:** Some videography companies book weddings but send associate shooters (often less experienced) to your event.

**What to ask:**
- Will YOU be my videographer, or will you send someone else?
- If sending an associate, can I see their work specifically?
- Will I meet them before the wedding?

**Green flag:** Solo videographers or small teams where you know exactly who's showing up to your wedding.

---

## 4. "What equipment do you use, and do you have backups?"

**Why this matters:** Equipment failures happen. Professional videographers carry backup cameras, lenses, audio recorders, batteries, and memory cards.

**What to ask:**
- What cameras do you shoot on? (Professional: Sony FX3/FX6, Canon C70, etc.)
- Do you have backup equipment for everything?
- How do you capture audio? (Wireless mics are essential for vows/speeches)

**Red flag:** If they're shooting on consumer gear or don't have backups, walk away.

---

## 5. "What's included in my package, and what are the add-ons?"

**Why this matters:** Hidden costs destroy budgets. Know exactly what you're getting.

**What's typically included:**
- Number of hours of coverage
- Number of shooters (1 or 2?)
- Highlight film (3-8 minutes)
- Full ceremony edit
- Full speeches/toasts edit
- Online delivery (private gallery link)

**Common add-ons:**
- Drone footage
- Raw footage delivery
- Extended highlight film
- Same-day edit (film shown at reception)
- Rehearsal dinner coverage

**Pro tip:** Ask for a detailed proposal in writing so there's no confusion.

---

## 6. "When will I receive my final films?"

**Why this matters:** Some videographers take 6-12 months to deliver. That's too long.

**Industry standard:**
- Teaser/sneak peek: 2-4 weeks
- Highlight film: 6-10 weeks
- Full feature film: 10-16 weeks

**Red flag:** If they can't give you a timeline or say "whenever it's done," that's unprofessional.

**Green flag:** Clear delivery dates in the contract with penalties if they miss deadlines.

---

## 7. "Can I choose the music for my film?"

**Why this matters:** Music sets the entire tone of your film.

**The reality:** Most couples trust the videographer to choose licensed music that fits the vibe. But if you have a specific song (your first dance song, a meaningful track), ask if they can incorporate it.

**Important:** Videographers need properly licensed music for your film. Don't expect them to use copyrighted songs from Spotify—those will get muted on YouTube/Instagram.

---

## 8. "What happens if you're sick or can't make my wedding?"

**Why this matters:** Life happens. Professional videographers have a backup plan.

**What to ask:**
- Do you have a network of trusted backup videographers?
- Will I get a refund if you can't find coverage?
- What's your policy if I need to reschedule?

**Green flag:** They have a contract clause covering this scenario and a clear backup plan.

---

## 9. "Do you have insurance?"

**Why this matters:** If your videographer trips and breaks a centerpiece, or damages venue property, liability insurance protects everyone.

**What to ask:**
- Do you carry liability insurance?
- Can you provide a certificate of insurance to my venue? (Many venues require this)

**Pro tip:** Most professional videographers carry $1-2M liability insurance. If they don't, that's a red flag.

---

## 10. "Can I see your contract before I book?"

**Why this matters:** The contract protects both of you. Read it carefully.

**What to look for:**
- Exact deliverables listed
- Timeline for delivery
- Cancellation/rescheduling policy
- Payment schedule
- Rights to your footage (can you post it online?)
- What happens if the videographer is sick/unavailable

**Red flag:** If they won't show you the contract until after you pay a deposit, run.

---

## Bonus Questions (If You Want to Go Deeper)

### 11. "How many weddings have you filmed?"

Experience matters. Someone who's filmed 50+ weddings knows how to handle unexpected situations.

### 12. "Have you filmed at my venue before?"

Familiarity with your venue is a huge plus. They'll know the best angles, lighting challenges, and venue rules.

### 13. "What's your backup plan for audio?"

Professional videographers use multiple audio sources:
- Wireless mics on the couple
- Backup recorder near the officiant
- On-camera mic as a third backup

### 14. "Will you coordinate with my photographer?"

Great videographers work seamlessly with photographers, not compete for space.

## Red Flags to Avoid

🚩 **They won't show full wedding films**
🚩 **No contract or vague contract terms**
🚩 **Prices seem too good to be true** ($500 for a full wedding film = you'll be disappointed)
🚩 **They don't have liability insurance**
🚩 **No backup equipment**
🚩 **They can't give you a delivery timeline**
🚩 **Poor communication** (taking days to respond to emails)

---

## Green Flags (Great Signs)

✅ **Clear portfolio of full films**
✅ **Professional equipment with backups**
✅ **Detailed contract with delivery timelines**
✅ **Liability insurance**
✅ **Great communication and responsiveness**
✅ **Glowing reviews from past couples**
✅ **They ask YOU questions about your vision**

---

## The Most Important Question of All

**"Do I feel comfortable with this person?"**

You're spending 8-10 hours with your videographer on the most important day of your life. If their vibe feels off, or you don't click, trust your gut.

The best videographer isn't just technically skilled—they're someone you trust to capture your story authentically.

---

## What to Do Next

Now that you know what to ask, here's how to move forward:

1. **Watch full films** from 3-5 videographers you like
2. **Schedule consultation calls** to ask these questions
3. **Compare proposals** side-by-side
4. **Check availability** for your date
5. **Book early** (great videographers book 12-18 months out for peak season)

---

## Ready to Talk?

If you're planning a wedding in NYC and looking for a videographer who prioritizes storytelling, clean audio, and timeless films, I'd love to chat.

I shoot on professional cinema cameras (Sony FX3/FX6), carry full backup equipment, and deliver films in 6-10 weeks. Most importantly, I'll be the one showing up to your wedding—not an associate.

# Selene & Isidro's Utah Mountain Wedding: A Love Story in Film

"Wow. Just... wow. The film brings us right back to that day so clearly. We keep discovering moments we didn't even know happened. It's like reliving the entire celebration all over again...WOW" — Selene & Isidro

When Selene and Isidro reached out to me about filming their Utah mountain wedding, I knew it would be special. The location alone—surrounded by Utah's stunning mountain landscapes—promised cinematic gold. But what made this wedding unforgettable wasn't just the scenery. It was the genuine emotion that radiated through every moment.

---

## The Vision

Selene and Isidro wanted their wedding film to feel authentic. No forced poses, no over-directed moments. They wanted the day to unfold naturally, with me there to capture it as it happened.

Their priorities:
- **Authentic emotion** over perfect staging
- **Family moments** woven throughout the film
- **The landscape** as a character in their story
- **Clean audio** of their vows (this was non-negotiable)

---

## The Location

The venue was a private estate nestled in the Utah mountains. Getting there required coordination—flights to Salt Lake City, then a drive through winding mountain roads. But the moment I arrived and saw the light hitting those peaks, I knew every mile was worth it.

**What made this location perfect for film:**
- **Natural light:** Mountain light is soft, directional, and changes throughout the day
- **Epic backdrops:** Every angle offered a stunning vista
- **Intimate setting:** The private estate meant we could move freely without crowds
- **Acoustic magic:** The mountains created natural reverb during the outdoor ceremony

---

## The Day

### Morning Prep

I started coverage during getting ready. Selene was calm, laughing with her bridesmaids, while Isidro was visibly nervous (in the best way). These quiet moments before the ceremony always reveal so much about a couple's dynamic.

**Key moments captured:**
- Selene's mother helping with her dress (tears were inevitable)
- Isidro's reaction seeing his boutonniere for the first time
- The bridesmaids toasting with champagne
- A quiet moment where Selene read a letter from Isidro

### The Ceremony

The ceremony was outdoors, with the mountains as the backdrop. I used two cameras:
- **Camera 1:** Wide shot capturing the full scene (couple, officiant, mountains)
- **Camera 2:** Close-ups of faces, hands, reactions

**Audio setup:**
- Wireless lavalier mic on Isidro (primary vow audio)
- Backup recorder near the officiant
- On-camera mic as tertiary backup

This triple-redundancy is why their vows sound crystal clear in the final film, even with wind in the mountains.

**The moment everyone cried:** During his vows, Isidro's voice broke. He paused, looked at Selene, and said, "I didn't think I'd cry, but here we are." The guests laughed through their tears. Selene squeezed his hands. It was raw, real, and beautiful.

### The Reception

The reception took place as the sun set behind the mountains—golden hour at its finest. I captured:
- First dance (Isidro twirled Selene and she laughed so hard she had to stop)
- Father-daughter dance (Selene's dad whispered something that made her cry)
- Toasts from friends and family (genuine, heartfelt, not rehearsed)
- Candid moments of guests dancing, laughing, celebrating

**Pro tip:** I always shoot reception details (centerpieces, place settings, cake) during cocktail hour when the light is still good and the room is empty. This ensures the details are beautifully lit and I'm not missing guest interactions later.

---

## Behind the Scenes: Technical Details

For anyone curious about the filmmaking process:

**Cameras:**
- Sony FX3 (primary camera)
- Sony A7S III (secondary/B-roll camera)

**Lenses:**
- 24-70mm f/2.8 (ceremony, wide shots)
- 70-200mm f/2.8 (emotional close-ups from a distance)
- 35mm f/1.4 (low-light reception, shallow depth of field)

**Audio:**
- Sennheiser wireless lav mics (2x)
- Zoom H6 recorder (backup/ambient sound)

**Stabilization:**
- DJI RS3 gimbal (smooth moving shots)
- Tripod (ceremony coverage)

**Drone:** We didn't fly a drone due to venue restrictions, but the mountains provided epic backdrops at eye level.

---

## The Film

The final highlight film clocks in at 7 minutes. It includes:
- Getting ready moments
- Full ceremony (vows, exchange of rings, first kiss)
- Family formals
- Golden hour couples portraits
- Reception highlights (first dance, toasts, dancing)

**The music:** I chose an instrumental track that builds from quiet piano to sweeping strings—it mirrors the emotional arc of the day.

**Selene's favorite moment in the film:** A candid shot of her and Isidro during cocktail hour, standing on a balcony overlooking the mountains. They thought they were alone. Isidro kissed her forehead, and she leaned into him. It's 4 seconds long, but she says it's her favorite part of the entire film.

---

## What They Said

> "Wow. Just... wow. The film brings us right back to that day so clearly. We keep discovering moments we didn't even know happened. It's like reliving the entire celebration all over again...WOW" — Selene & Isidro

This is why I do what I do. Their wedding film isn't just a video—it's a portal back to one of the most important days of their lives.

## Planning a Mountain Wedding? Here's What I Learned

If you're planning a destination or mountain wedding, here are my tips:

### 1. **Scout the location (or hire someone who has filmed there)**
I arrived a day early to walk the venue, note the light at different times, and plan camera positions. This prep made the wedding day seamless.

### 2. **Audio is harder outdoors**
Wind, distance, and acoustics are challenges. A professional videographer will have backup mics and know how to handle outdoor audio.

### 3. **Golden hour is your friend**
Plan your couples portraits for the hour before sunset. The light is soft, warm, and cinematic.

### 4. **Trust your vendors**
Selene and Isidro gave me creative freedom, and that trust allowed me to capture authentic moments without hovering or directing.

### 5. **Prep for weather**
Mountain weather can change quickly. Have a backup plan for rain, wind, or cold.
