    commonQuestions: [
      {
        q: "How long does a Catholic wedding ceremony typically last?",
        a: "A full Catholic wedding Mass typically runs 60-90 minutes, including the Liturgy of the Word and Liturgy of the Eucharist. A ceremony without Mass (ceremony of the word) is usually 30-45 minutes and is often used for interfaith marriages."
      },
      {
        q: "What is Pre-Cana and is it required?",
        a: "Pre-Cana is the Catholic Church's marriage preparation program that engaged couples must complete before their wedding. It typically involves classes or a retreat covering topics like communication, finances, faith, and family planning. Requirements vary by diocese but usually involve 6-8 months of preparation."
      },
      {
        q: "Can couples write their own vows in a Catholic wedding?",
        a: "While couples must exchange the traditional consent ('I do' or the longer form), many priests allow couples to include personal vows or promises after the official exchange. The traditional vows are non-negotiable as they constitute the sacrament, but personalization is often welcomed in addition."
      },
      {
        q: "What's the difference between a Nuptial Mass and a ceremony without Mass?",
        a: "A Nuptial Mass includes the full Catholic Mass with Communion and typically lasts 60-90 minutes. A ceremony without Mass (also called a ceremony of the word) includes readings, vows, and blessings but no Eucharist, lasting 30-45 minutes. This shorter version is common for interfaith marriages or when one partner is not Catholic."
      },
      {
        q: "Are Catholic weddings always held in a church?",
        a: "Traditionally, yes. The Catholic Church requires weddings to take place in a Catholic church or chapel, as marriage is considered a sacrament. However, some dioceses may grant permission for outdoor or alternative venue weddings in special circumstances, though this is rare and requires bishop approval."

        q: "What is the significance of the ketubah?",
        a: "The ketubah is a Jewish marriage contract that has been used for over 2,000 years. Written in Aramaic, it outlines the husband's obligations to his wife including food, clothing, and conjugal rights. Today, many couples use egalitarian ketubot (plural) with modern language and beautiful artistic designs. It's signed before the ceremony by the couple and two witnesses."
      },
      {
        q: "Why do Jewish weddings take place under a chuppah?",
        a: "The chuppah (wedding canopy) symbolizes the home the couple will build together. It's open on all sides, representing hospitality and welcoming guests, and is often decorated with flowers or a tallit (prayer shawl). The openness also recalls Abraham's tent, which was open on all four sides to welcome travelers."
      },
      {
        q: "What does breaking the glass symbolize?",
        a: "Breaking the glass has multiple meanings: it commemorates the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (a reminder that even in joy, we remember sorrow), represents the fragility of human relationships (requiring constant care), and serves as a reminder that marriage will have both joyous and challenging moments. When the groom steps on the glass, guests shout 'Mazel Tov!' (congratulations)."
      },
      {
        q: "What is the hora and why is it danced?",
        a: "The hora is a traditional circle dance performed at Jewish celebrations. During weddings, guests dance in circles around the couple, who are often lifted on chairs while holding a handkerchief or napkin between them. It's a joyous celebration of the new marriage and represents the community's support for the couple."
      },
      {
        q: "What's the difference between Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jewish weddings?",
        a: "Orthodox weddings are the most traditional, with men and women often separated during the ceremony and reception. Conservative weddings blend tradition with modernity, typically allowing mixed seating. Reform weddings are the most flexible, often incorporating personalized elements and modern interpretations. All three include core traditions like the chuppah, ketubah, and breaking of the glass, but vary in strictness of observance."

        q: "What is Kanyadaan and why is it emotional?",
        a: "Kanyadaan literally means 'giving away the daughter' and is one of the most emotional moments of an Indian wedding. The bride's father (or parents) places her hand in the groom's, symbolizing the transfer of responsibility and blessing for the new union. It represents the parents entrusting their daughter to her new family and is often accompanied by tears and deep emotion."

Traditionally, the groom arrives on a decorated horse (though cars and elephants are also used) accompanied by family and friends dancing to dhol drums and music. This celebratory procession announces the groom's arrival and is greeted by the bride's family with the Milni ceremony, where both families formally meet and exchange garlands."
      },
      {
        q: "Why do Hindu weddings last so long?",
        a: "Hindu wedding ceremonies are long (2-4 hours) because they consist of numerous Vedic rituals, each with specific meaning and Sanskrit mantras. The pandit (priest) guides the couple through rituals like Ganesh Puja (removing obstacles), Kanyadaan (giving away the bride), Saat Phere (seven circles), and applying Sindoor and Mangalsutra. Each ritual cannot be rushed and must be performed at auspicious times."

        a: "Indian weddings vary significantly by region and community. North Indian (Punjabi/Hindi) weddings feature the Baraat and often more elaborate sangeet celebrations. South Indian weddings may include rituals like tying the Thali (sacred thread). Gujarati weddings have unique customs like the Garba dance. Bengali weddings involve rituals with a betel leaf. Despite differences, most include core elements like sacred fire, seven vows, and multi-day celebrations."

        q: "What is the significance of the Stefana (crowns)?",
        a: "The Stefana are ceremonial crowns joined by a ribbon, representing the glory and honor bestowed upon the couple as they become king and queen of their own domestic church. They also symbolize the martyrdom of marriage—the sacrifices spouses make for each other. The crowns are a visible sign of God's blessing and the couple's new roles. Many couples preserve their stefana as precious family heirlooms."

        q: "What role does the Koumbaro/Koumbara play?",
        a: "The Koumbaro (male) or Koumbara (female) is more than a best man or maid of honor—they're a spiritual sponsor who participates actively in the ceremony. They exchange the rings and crowns three times over the couple's heads, assist throughout the ceremony, and become lifelong spiritual advisors to the couple and often godparents to their children. This is a sacred, lifelong bond of responsibility."

        q: "What are Koufeta and why are they given in odd numbers?",
        a: "Koufeta are sugar-coated almonds traditionally given to wedding guests in odd numbers (5 or 7 pieces). Each almond in a set of five represents a wish: health, wealth, happiness, fertility, and long life. Odd numbers are indivisible, symbolizing that the couple will remain undivided. The bitter almond coated in sweet sugar represents life's bitter and sweet moments that the couple will share."

        q: "Can non-Orthodox people have a Greek Orthodox wedding?",
        a: "For a valid Greek Orthodox wedding, at least one partner must be a baptized member of the Orthodox Church. If one partner is not Orthodox, they may need to convert before the wedding, though requirements vary by jurisdiction. The Church typically does not perform interfaith marriages, though some exceptions may be made. Couples should consult with their parish priest well in advance."

        q: "What are the Veil, Cord, and Coins ceremonies?",
        a: "These are the three unique Filipino wedding traditions performed during the Catholic ceremony. The Veil ceremony involves sponsors draping a white veil over the couple, symbolizing unity. The Cord (or Lasso) is a decorative loop placed around them in a figure-eight, representing their eternal bond. The Coins (Arras) are 13 coins given by the groom to the bride, symbolizing his promise to provide and their shared commitment to prosperity. These rituals are performed after the vows and before communion."

        q: "What is a Barong Tagalog and when is it worn?",
        a: "The Barong Tagalog is a traditional Filipino formal shirt made of lightweight fabric (often piña or jusi) with intricate embroidery. It's worn untucked and is the formal attire for Filipino grooms and male guests at weddings. The Barong represents Filipino cultural pride and elegance. Women wear the Filipiniana dress or terno, which features butterfly sleeves and elegant embroidery."

        q: "Who are the principal sponsors and what do they do?",
        a: "Principal sponsors (Ninong and Ninang) are like godparents for the marriage—respected elders chosen by the couple to guide and support them throughout their married life. They participate in the ceremony by performing the Veil and Cord rituals and signing as official witnesses. Having many sponsors is common, showing the community's support for the marriage."

      {
        q: "What is the money dance and why do guests pin money?",
        a: "The money dance (also called Salu-Salo or Dollar Dance) is a reception tradition where guests take turns dancing with the bride and groom while pinning paper money on their clothing. It's a fun, interactive way to celebrate and help the newlyweds start their married life with financial blessings. The money belongs to the couple and helps offset wedding costs or honeymoon expenses."
      },
      {
        q: "Are Filipino weddings always Catholic?",
        a: "The majority of Filipino weddings are Catholic due to the Philippines' strong Catholic heritage (over 80% of Filipinos are Catholic). However, there are Protestant, Iglesia ni Cristo, and Muslim Filipino weddings as well. Even secular Filipino weddings often incorporate cultural elements like the veil, cord, and coins ceremonies adapted for non-religious contexts."

    commonQuestions: [
      {
        q: "What is the Anand Karaj and what does it mean?",
        a: "Anand Karaj means 'blissful union' in Punjabi and is the Sikh wedding ceremony. It's a sacred spiritual union performed before the Guru Granth Sahib (Sikh holy scripture) in a Gurdwara. The ceremony emphasizes that marriage is a spiritual partnership where two souls become one, joining in devotion to God. Unlike other traditions, it's not just a social contract but a path to spiritual enlightenment together."

      {
        q: "What are the Four Lavaan and what do they represent?",
        a: "The Four Lavaan are wedding hymns written by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru. During the ceremony, the couple walks around the Guru Granth Sahib four times while these hymns are sung. Each Lavan represents a stage: 1) Emphasis on duty and worldly life, 2) Meeting the True Guru and beginning spiritual journey, 3) Detachment from worldly attractions and love for God, 4) Achievement of spiritual union and bliss. Walking together symbolizes their journey through married life toward enlightenment."
      },
      {
        q: "Why must Sikh weddings take place in a Gurdwara?",
        a: "Sikh weddings must occur in a Gurdwara before the Guru Granth Sahib because the Guru is the central witness to the marriage. The Guru Granth Sahib represents the eternal Guru for Sikhs, and the marriage vows are made in its presence, not just between two people. Having the ceremony anywhere else would not be considered a valid Anand Karaj according to Sikh religious law."
      },
      {
        q: "What should I wear and what is the etiquette in a Gurdwara?",
        a: "Cover your head (women with a scarf/dupatta, men with a handkerchief or turban), remove shoes before entering, and dress modestly (shoulders and legs covered). Avoid alcohol before attending. Sit cross-legged or with legs folded on the floor during the ceremony—never point your feet toward the Guru Granth Sahib. Participate respectfully in the Ardas (prayer) by standing, and accept Karah Prasad (sweet offering) with both hands as a blessing."
      },
      {
        q: "How is a Sikh wedding different from a Hindu wedding?",
        a: "While both may share Punjabi cultural elements (Sangeet, Mehndi, Baraat), Sikh weddings are religiously distinct. Sikh ceremonies occur in a Gurdwara before the Guru Granth Sahib with Four Lavaan, while Hindu weddings occur around a sacred fire with Saat Phere (seven circles). Sikh weddings emphasize spiritual equality and partnership, while Hindu ceremonies involve more elaborate rituals and a pandit. Sikh weddings are typically shorter (30-45 minutes) and alcohol-free."
