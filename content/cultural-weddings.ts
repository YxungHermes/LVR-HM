The ceremony follows a rich liturgical structure with deep spiritual significance, typically lasting 60-90 minutes for a full Nuptial Mass or 30-45 minutes for a ceremony without Mass.",

        "Many churches restrict movement and photography during the consecration and Eucharist",
        "Couples must typically complete Pre-Cana (marriage preparation) classes",
        "The ceremony may include full Mass with Communion or just the ceremony of the word",
        "Interfaith couples may have a ceremony without Mass, which is shorter",

    commonQuestions: [
      {
        q: "How long does a Catholic wedding ceremony typically last?",
        a: "A full Catholic wedding Mass typically runs 60-90 minutes, including the Liturgy of the Word and Liturgy of the Eucharist. A ceremony without Mass (ceremony of the word) is usually 30-45 minutes and is often used for interfaith marriages."
      },
      {
        q: "What is Pre-Cana and is it required?",
        a: "Pre-Cana is the Catholic Church's marriage preparation program that engaged couples must complete before their wedding. It typically involves classes or a retreat covering topics like communication, finances, faith, and family planning. Requirements vary by diocese but usually involve 6-8 months of preparation."
      },
      {
        q: "Can couples write their own vows in a Catholic wedding?",
        a: "While couples must exchange the traditional consent ('I do' or the longer form), many priests allow couples to include personal vows or promises after the official exchange. The traditional vows are non-negotiable as they constitute the sacrament, but personalization is often welcomed in addition."
      },
      {
        q: "What's the difference between a Nuptial Mass and a ceremony without Mass?",
        a: "A Nuptial Mass includes the full Catholic Mass with Communion and typically lasts 60-90 minutes. A ceremony without Mass (also called a ceremony of the word) includes readings, vows, and blessings but no Eucharist, lasting 30-45 minutes. This shorter version is common for interfaith marriages or when one partner is not Catholic."
      },
      {
        q: "Are Catholic weddings always held in a church?",
        a: "Traditionally, yes. The Catholic Church requires weddings to take place in a Catholic church or chapel, as marriage is considered a sacrament. However, some dioceses may grant permission for outdoor or alternative venue weddings in special circumstances, though this is rare and requires bishop approval."

    commonQuestions: [
      {
        q: "What is the significance of the ketubah?",
        a: "The ketubah is a Jewish marriage contract that has been used for over 2,000 years. Written in Aramaic, it outlines the husband's obligations to his wife including food, clothing, and conjugal rights. Today, many couples use egalitarian ketubot (plural) with modern language and beautiful artistic designs. It's signed before the ceremony by the couple and two witnesses."
      },
      {
        q: "Why do Jewish weddings take place under a chuppah?",
        a: "The chuppah (wedding canopy) symbolizes the home the couple will build together. It's open on all sides, representing hospitality and welcoming guests, and is often decorated with flowers or a tallit (prayer shawl). The openness also recalls Abraham's tent, which was open on all four sides to welcome travelers."
      },
      {
        q: "What does breaking the glass symbolize?",
        a: "Breaking the glass has multiple meanings: it commemorates the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (a reminder that even in joy, we remember sorrow), represents the fragility of human relationships (requiring constant care), and serves as a reminder that marriage will have both joyous and challenging moments. When the groom steps on the glass, guests shout 'Mazel Tov!' (congratulations)."
      },
      {
        q: "What is the hora and why is it danced?",
        a: "The hora is a traditional circle dance performed at Jewish celebrations. During weddings, guests dance in circles around the couple, who are often lifted on chairs while holding a handkerchief or napkin between them. It's a joyous celebration of the new marriage and represents the community's support for the couple."
      },
      {
        q: "What's the difference between Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jewish weddings?",
        a: "Orthodox weddings are the most traditional, with men and women often separated during the ceremony and reception. Conservative weddings blend tradition with modernity, typically allowing mixed seating. Reform weddings are the most flexible, often incorporating personalized elements and modern interpretations. All three include core traditions like the chuppah, ketubah, and breaking of the glass, but vary in strictness of observance."

        a: "The Saat Phere (seven circles around the sacred fire) are the core of a Hindu wedding ceremony. Each circle represents a vow for married life: nourishment, strength, prosperity, happiness, progeny, longevity, and harmony. The Agni (fire) serves as a divine witness to these promises. This ritual is considered the moment the couple is officially married."

        q: "What is Kanyadaan and why is it emotional?",
        a: "Kanyadaan literally means 'giving away the daughter' and is one of the most emotional moments of an Indian wedding. The bride's father (or parents) places her hand in the groom's, symbolizing the transfer of responsibility and blessing for the new union. It represents the parents entrusting their daughter to her new family and is often accompanied by tears and deep emotion."
      },
      {
        q: "What happens during the Baraat?",
        a: "The Baraat is the groom's wedding procession to the ceremony venue. Traditionally, the groom arrives on a decorated horse (though cars and elephants are also used) accompanied by family and friends dancing to dhol drums and music. This celebratory procession announces the groom's arrival and is greeted by the bride's family with the Milni ceremony, where both families formally meet and exchange garlands."
      },
      {
        q: "Why do Hindu weddings last so long?",
        a: "Hindu wedding ceremonies are long (2-4 hours) because they consist of numerous Vedic rituals, each with specific meaning and Sanskrit mantras. The pandit (priest) guides the couple through rituals like Ganesh Puja (removing obstacles), Kanyadaan (giving away the bride), Saat Phere (seven circles), and applying Sindoor and Mangalsutra. Each ritual cannot be rushed and must be performed at auspicious times."
      },
      {
        q: "What are the main differences between regional Indian weddings?",
        a: "Indian weddings vary significantly by region and community. North Indian (Punjabi/Hindi) weddings feature the Baraat and often more elaborate sangeet celebrations. South Indian weddings may include rituals like tying the Thali (sacred thread). Gujarati weddings have unique customs like the Garba dance. Bengali weddings involve rituals with a betel leaf. Despite differences, most include core elements like sacred fire, seven vows, and multi-day celebrations."
