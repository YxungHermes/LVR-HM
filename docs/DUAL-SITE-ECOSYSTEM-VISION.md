# **MICHAEL ANDRADE - DUAL WEBSITE ECOSYSTEM**

**Domain:** michael-andrade.com
**Current Focus:** Wedding site
**Future Vision:** Dual-site portal system with interactive transitions

---

## **OVERVIEW: THE BIG PICTURE**

This website will eventually consist of **three interconnected parts:**

1. **Portal Landing Page** - Interactive choice page (michael-andrade.com)
2. **Wedding Site** - Luxury wedding videography (michael-andrade.com/weddings)
3. **Production Site** - YxungHermes (michael-andrade.com/production or yxunghermes.com)

---

## **BRANDING CONSIDERATIONS & ALTERNATIVES**

### **Wedding Brand Name - Two Options Under Consideration**

**OPTION A: Love, Violeta Rose** (Current)
- Romantic, poetic, memorable
- Creates distinct brand separate from personal name
- More boutique/luxury positioning
- Could stand alone as its own entity
- Partner Caitlyn's connection (Violeta)
- Pros: Unique, romantic, brandable
- Cons: Less direct connection to Michael's name

**OPTION B: Weddings by Michael Andrade**
- Direct, personal, clear
- Leverages Michael's personal brand
- More straightforward positioning
- Easier for referrals ("I used Michael Andrade")
- All business under one name umbrella
- Pros: Clear, professional, personal brand building
- Cons: More generic, less distinctive

**Current Status:** Using "Love, Violeta Rose" throughout this document as primary brand. Decision can be revisited before launch.

**Domain Implications:**
- Option A: Could use lovevioletarose.com or subdirectory
- Option B: Naturally fits under michael-andrade.com/weddings

**Note:** Throughout this vision document, "Love, Violeta Rose" is used as the reference brand name, but all concepts apply equally to "Weddings by Michael Andrade" if that direction is chosen.

---

## **PART 1: THE PORTAL LANDING PAGE**

**Purpose:** Allow visitors to choose between wedding videography and commercial/production work

### **Visual Design Concept**

**Layout:**
- Split screen with organic portal boundary (NOT a straight vertical line)
- LEFT: Wedding world
- RIGHT: Production world
- CENTER: Fluid, organic boundary/portal that shifts based on interaction

**Interaction Behavior:**

**Hover LEFT (Wedding Side):**
- Wedding side expands and begins to "consume" production side
- Portal boundary shifts smoothly to the right
- Production side compresses and dims
- Wedding footage becomes more prominent
- Elegant, romantic expansion

**Hover RIGHT (Production Side):**
- Production side expands and begins to "consume" wedding side
- Portal boundary shifts smoothly to the left
- Wedding side compresses and dims
- Commercial footage becomes more prominent
- Bold, dynamic expansion

**Neutral/Center State:**
- Balanced view of both worlds
- Organic portal boundary has subtle movement/glow
- Both sides equally visible
- Inviting exploration of either direction

**Click to Enter:**
- Chosen side expands fully
- Other side fades completely
- Transition animation begins (see below)

---

### **TRANSITION ANIMATIONS**

**TO WEDDING SITE (Left Side Click):**

**The Ring Flip Transition:**

1. **Ring appears from left side**
   - Wedding ring enters frame from left portal edge
   - Ring is flipping/spinning in 3D space
   - Tumbling motion, elegant rotation

2. **Ring moves to center and enlarges**
   - Ring smoothly animates to center of screen
   - Continues spinning while scaling up
   - Ring grows to fill majority of viewport

3. **Zoom into ring/diamond**
   - Camera/view zooms into the circular band or diamond
   - Round opening of ring becomes a circular mask
   - Everything outside the ring darkens/blurs

4. **Ring becomes portal**
   - The circular opening of the ring expands
   - Acts as a mask revealing the wedding website behind it
   - Zoom continues through the ring portal
   - Ring edges fade out as we pass "through" it
   - Wedding website fully revealed

5. **Complete transition**
   - Now fully in wedding website
   - Smooth, elegant, memorable entrance
   - Reinforces wedding/romance theme

**Technical Complexity:** HIGH
- Requires 3D animation (Lottie, Three.js, or WebGL)
- Complex masking and timing
- Performance optimization critical
- Fallback transition needed for slower connections

**Implementation Timeline:** Phase 3 (after both sites are built)

---

**TO PRODUCTION SITE (Right Side Click):**

**Simpler, Bolder Transition:**

- Fast cut or dynamic swipe
- Quick zoom into production footage
- More aggressive, less romantic
- Could be glitch effect, hard cut, or fast slide
- Reflects edgier production aesthetic

**Technical Complexity:** MEDIUM
- Simpler than ring animation
- Can use CSS transitions primarily
- Faster, more aggressive feel appropriate for this side

## **COLOR PSYCHOLOGY & CONTRAST**

**Why This Works:**

**Wedding Site (Light):**
- Light = romance, purity, celebration, hope
- Soft tones = approachable, warm, trustworthy
- Timeless elegance
- Appeals to couples planning their special day

**Production Site (Dark):**
- Black = cinema, production, industry standard
- Dark = bold, professional, serious craft
- Premium in a different register
- Appeals to artists, brands, businesses
- Makes colorful work pop against dark canvas

**The Portal:**
- Visual metaphor: choosing between two worlds
- Light vs. Dark = romance vs. production
- Soft vs. Bold = wedding vs. commercial
- Instantly communicates the difference
- Memorable, unique positioning

---

## **DOMAIN STRUCTURE OPTIONS**

**Option A: Subdirectories (Recommended)**
- michael-andrade.com → Portal landing page
- michael-andrade.com/weddings → Wedding site
- michael-andrade.com/production → YxungHermes site

**Option B: Subdomains**
- michael-andrade.com → Portal
- weddings.michael-andrade.com → Wedding site
- work.michael-andrade.com → YxungHermes

**Option C: Separate Domains with Portal**
- michael-andrade.com → Portal
- lovevioletarose.com OR weddingsbyma.com → Wedding site (separate domain)
- yxunghermes.com → Production site (separate domain)

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A for simplicity, can migrate to C later if brands grow independently

---

## **IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**

### **PHASE 1: CURRENT (In Progress)**
**Focus: Wedding Site**

**Priorities:**
- Complete hero section refinements (smooth animations, elegant timing)
- Fix "Choose Your Story" box interactions (tactile, premium feel)
- Improve "Signature Work" video card readability
- Add testimonials section
- Finalize all pages (Home, Films, Offerings, Process, About, Contact)
- **Decide on final brand name** (Love, Violeta Rose vs. Weddings by Michael Andrade)
- Polish, test, optimize
- **Go live with wedding site**

**Timeline:** Complete ASAP (current priority)

---

### **PHASE 2: NEXT (3-6 Months Out)**
**Focus: Production Site - YxungHermes**

**Priorities:**
- Build production site from scratch
- Black aesthetic, bold design
- Organize non-wedding portfolio work
- Create service packages for commercial work
- Define brand voice for production side
- Test separately before connecting to portal
- **Launch production site**

**Timeline:** After wedding site is stable and generating revenue

---

### **PHASE 3: FUTURE (6-12 Months Out)**
**Focus: Portal Landing Page & Transitions**

**Priorities:**
- Design and build portal landing page
- Implement organic portal/boundary interaction
- Build ring flip transition animation (wedding side)
- Build production side transition
- Connect all three pieces
- Test full user journey
- Performance optimization
- **Launch complete ecosystem**

**Timeline:** After both individual sites are proven and successful

**Note:** The ring transition is complex and expensive. Consider:
- Building simpler version first
- Testing demand/traffic before investing in full 3D animation
- Could hire specialist animator for ring sequence
- Fallback to simpler transition if needed for performance

---

## **TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS**

**Performance:**
- All sites must be fast (< 3 second load)
- Video optimization critical
- Lazy loading for below-fold content
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Video Hosting:**
- Vimeo for portfolio films (professional embed)
- Self-hosted or CDN for background videos (optimized files)
- Multiple resolutions for different devices

**Animations:**
- CSS/GSAP for standard interactions
- Three.js/WebGL for complex 3D (ring transition)
- Lottie for vector animations
- Always have fallbacks for older browsers

**SEO:**
- Each site optimized independently
- Portal page needs clear meta for both services
- Separate sitemaps for wedding and production
- Schema markup for video content

---

## **BRAND POSITIONING**

**Wedding Side:**
- Premium luxury wedding videography
- $2,500-$10,000+ packages

- Emotional, romantic, timeless
- Brand name TBD: Love, Violeta Rose OR Weddings by Michael Andrade

**YxungHermes:**
- Versatile production and commercial work
- Variable pricing (per project)
- Target: Artists, brands, businesses, events
- Bold, creative, professional

**Together:**

---

## **CURRENT STATUS**

✅ **Completed:**
- Wedding site structure built
- Basic pages and navigation
- Video integration
- Initial styling

🚧 **In Progress:**
- Hero section animation refinement
- Interactive box hover effects
- Video card readability improvements
- Content population
- **Brand name decision needed**

⏳ **Not Started:**
- Production site (Phase 2)
- Portal landing page (Phase 3)
- Ring transition animation (Phase 3)

---

## **NOTES & REMINDERS**

**Philosophy:**
- Don't rush to build everything at once
- Wedding site is the revenue generator - prioritize it
- Production site can wait until wedding site is proven
- Portal is the "cherry on top" - fun but not essential initially
- Each piece should work independently before connecting

**The Ring Transition:**
- Cool idea, highly memorable
- Very complex to execute well
- Consider simpler alternatives first
- Can always upgrade later
- Don't let it delay the core sites

**Brand Name Decision:**
- Love, Violeta Rose = Romantic, distinctive, partner connection
- Weddings by Michael Andrade = Personal brand, direct, clear
- Decision impacts domain strategy and branding consistency
- Should be finalized before public launch
- Both work with the overall dual-site portal vision

**Keep It Simple:**
- Start with functional, beautiful basics
- Add complexity only when it serves the user experience
- Premium feel comes from refinement, not feature count
- Better to do simple things perfectly than complex things poorly

---

## **VISION STATEMENT**

This dual-site ecosystem represents Michael Andrade's complete videography offering: romantic wedding storytelling on one side, and bold commercial production under YxungHermes on the other. Connected by an interactive portal that lets visitors choose their path, the entire experience is designed to be memorable, premium, and perfectly tailored to each audience. The wedding side is soft, elegant, and timeless. The production side is bold, dark, and dynamic. Together, they showcase the full range of Michael's craft while keeping each client type in their own optimized world - all unified under the michael-andrade.com domain with seamless, cinematic transitions between worlds.
